For a number N, whose prime factorization is Xa × Yb, we get the total number of factors by adding 1 to each exponent and then multiplying these together.

To find the remainder when 4^24 is divided by 5, 
Start by finding the remainders of successive powers of 4 when divided by 5:
4^1 % 5 = 4
4^2 % 5 = 16 % 5 = 1
4^3 % 5 = 64 % 5 = 4
4^4 % 5 = 256 % 5 = 1
You'll notice that the remainders of 4^n alternate between 1 and 4. Specifically, when n is even, the remainder is 1, and when n is odd, the remainder is 4.

Sum of first n numbers = n(n+1)/2

0.0255 = 255/10000  = 51/2000

Let numbers are 1x and 4x

LCM = 4x​
 
725^2/3 = 3^(6*(2/3)) = 3^4 = 81

avg of first n numbers is (n+1)/2

avg of square of first n numbers is (n+1)*(2n+1)/6x











10 m/s * 3.6 km/hr/m/s = 36 km/hr

So, 10 meters per second is equivalent to 36 kilometers per hour.

Explanation - Due to stoppages, it covers 15 km less.

Time taken to cover 15 km = (15/40) * 60 min = 10min

During a trip of 400 km, an airplane was slowed down due to the monsoon. Its average speed for the trip was reduced by 150 km/hr and the time of the airplane increased by 30 minutes. The duration of the airplane is :


A car can travel 30% faster than a bus. Car and bus both start from point P at the same time and reach point Q 55 kms away from P at the same time. On the way, however, the car lost about 9.5 minutes while stopping at the traffic. The speed of the bus is : 

when it comes to finding the percentage just take the base requirements as 100 itself

profit % = (S.P - C.P/C.P)*100

gain % = ((100+common gain)^2-100^2)%/100

loss %= ( - S.P + C.P/C.P)*100

S.I - total returns  = principle + simple intrest,Simple intrest = Principlle*time*rate/100

C.I - total returns = principle(1+r/100)^n,where r is in %
 
If Diff. between SI & CI for 2 years is Rs. x, then Principal = x (100/r)^2,only C.I without P that is p(r/100)^t

S.I = Actual - principle, here the sum represents the actual

if you have consecutive years of S.I then find the difference betwen them like E.G: 4 th year and 5 th year

to find the next term in a proportion series just find the mutiple between them or the difference b/w and use it to find the third or the next one

total number of possiblities is n!

if repetetion is allowed then possiblities is 4*4*4*4 for 4 numbers or alphabets

if repetetion is not allowed then possiblities is 1*2*3*4 for 4 number or alphabets

// Q what will be the total number of matches in a Particular series in which there are 15 teams and each team plays only one Match with others?

The answer is 15C2

the reason y it is combination and not perumtation is :

a team can play only with other teams and cant play against itself thus repetition is not allowed and thus permutation is not allowed

// Q find the total number of four-digit numbers which are divisible by 5 that can be formed with the digits 5, 7, 3, 2, and 1 If the Repetition of digits is allowed?

Here the repetetion is allowed thus 5*5*5*1 the last position is reserved only for 5 becoz it should be divivsible by 5

// Q In “MOTIHHARI” M appears 1 time, R 1 time, O 1 time,  T 1 time,  H 2 times, A 1 time, I 2 times 

thus answer is 9!/2!*2! , 2! represents the  repetetion of I and H


permutation - there are 3! = 3 x 2 x 1 = 6 different permutations of arranging two books. These permutations are: {A, B}, {A, C}, {B, A}, {B, C}, {C, A}, and {C, B}. order doesnt matters and repetetion is allowed when switching the places

combination - So, there are 3 different combinations of books you can choose to read: {A, B}, {A, C}, and {B, C}. orders matters and repetetion in switching is allowed

In “MOTIHARI” M appears 1 time, R 1 time, O 1 time,  T 1 time,  H 1 time, A 1 time, I 2 times therefore:
possiblities is 8!/2!

How many three-digit even Numbers can be formed using digits 2, 8, 9, 6, and 1 such that repetition is allowed?  Possible even Numbers = 5×5×3=75,where 3 represents that the even numbers alone come in that position.

chosen or arrranged - combination like n! becoz arranged means so character cant be repeated 

without order - permutation then it is n*n*n*n*n , hte char can be repeated n no of times

// Q the central government of India to form a committee of 14 persons to be formed from 10 men and 8 women for a special investigation. In how many ways can this be done Such that 6 women are always present?  

the answer is 10C8 * 8C6 , the reason y it is multipliedd becoz after selecting formt he grp again men vs women combination occurs 

// Q 6 Ola scooters and 7 Anther scooters be arranged in a row so that no two Ola scooters are together? 

in here the answer is 8P6(8 posiitons and 6 ola scooters) * 7P7(7 positions 7 anther scooters), here all ola scooters are same thus repetetion is allowed or placing any ola scooter anywhere means the same

// Q Find the number of ways in which 10 different books can be arranged on a shelf so that 2 particular books are never together. 

Number of ways two particular books are together = Total number of arrangements - arrangements where the particular books are together. 

Total number of ways 10 books can be arranged : 10! Ways

Ways of arranging books where two particular books are together: 9!×2!

P(A intersection B) = P(A) + P(B)

P(union) = P(A) + P(B) + P(A intersection B)

Therefore, the required number of ways = 10! - (9! * 2!),(9! * 2!) this represents that the last two postions are occured for tat particular books 

Relative speed of train where man and train same direction =>R(S) = T(S) + M(S),if opposite then R(S) = T(S) - M(S)

length of train = distance ,speed = speed, time = passing a pole or something(reference)

crossing bridge = length of bridge + length of train

train cross a platform includes (platform length + length of train)

same side then add the relative speed = S(T) +S(M),Distance = ahead_Dis / length(A) + length(B),find the time

opposite side then add the relative speed = S(T) -S(M), Distance = ahead_Dis / length(A) + length(B),find the time

Father is twice the age of son

x = 2y at that time , thus need to be carefull with it

When you find age you will be actual finding age for the reference time frame and not the present time thus be carefull

After 8 years, he would be two and a half times of Ronit's age.

x + 8 = 2.5(2y + 8)

UP(S) = S(B) + S(R)

DN(S) = S(B) - S(R)

D/S(UP) - D/S(DN) = T.T

After 

G.p :

Tn = a*r^n-1

It is same for the Distance speed and time
